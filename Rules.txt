Welcome to Trivia Night. Sit back, relax, and trivia. This game is made to engage your knowledge and thinking
to solve probems. These problems are split up into 6 different categories being sports, famous people, countries,
movies/shows, history, and random facts. In each one of these sections, you will be prompted with questions and have
6 lives to try your best to answer all the questions. To get points you will be given a question and will have to answer
it in a text box and either press the submit button or the enter key on your keyboard. If you get the answer right then
you will be given the next question and your score will increase by 1. If you get the question wrong then you will 
lose a heart and the right answer will be given to you under the text box. Once you have completed the game, you will 
be brought to a screen that will display your name, the category that you chose, and the score that you got.
